<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GFRP Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smooth GFRB Rebars</li><li>Sand Coated GFRP Rebars</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smooth GFRP rebars are made of glass fibers embedded in a resin matrix, providing high tensile strength and corrosion resistance. They are commonly used in construction projects where traditional steel rebars would corrode. Sand-coated GFRP rebars, on the other hand, have an additional layer of sand coating for better bonding with concrete. They provide enhanced durability and adhesion compared to smooth GFRP rebars, making them suitable for more demanding structural applications. Both types offer sustainable and long-lasting reinforcement solutions for a variety of construction projects.</p></p>
