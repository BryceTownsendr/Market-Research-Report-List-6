<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inherent Flame Retardant Fabric</li><li>Treated Flame Retardant Fabric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inherent Flame Retardant Fabric refers to fabrics that are manufactured with flame-retardant properties integrated into the molecular structure of the fibers, providing permanent protection against fire. Treated Flame Retardant Fabric, on the other hand, are fabrics that have been chemically treated with flame-retardant agents to enhance their fire-resistant properties. While inherent fabrics offer long-lasting protection, treated fabrics may require reapplication of flame-retardant chemicals over time. Both types of flame retardant fabrics are essential for use in industries where fire safety is a priority.</p></p>
