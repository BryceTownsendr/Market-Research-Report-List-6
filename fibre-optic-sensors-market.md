<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic sensors market is divided into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic sensors. Intrinsic sensors utilize the optical fiber itself as both the sensor and transmission medium, measuring changes in physical properties like temperature or pressure directly within the fiber. In contrast, extrinsic sensors use the fiber to transmit light to an external sensing element, which detects the physical changes. Both types leverage the advantages of optical fibers, such as sensitivity and immunity to electromagnetic interference.</p></p>
