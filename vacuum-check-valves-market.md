<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Check Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lift Check Valve</li><li>Swing Check Valve</li><li>Butterfly Check Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum check valves are devices used to prevent backflow in vacuum systems. There are three main types: lift check valves, swing check valves, and butterfly check valves. Lift check valves use a piston or ball to prevent flow in one direction. Swing check valves have a swinging disc that blocks flow when closed. Butterfly check valves use a rotating disc to control flow. Each type has its own unique design and application, but all serve the same purpose of maintaining vacuum pressure in a system.</p></p>
