<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile LiDAR Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Solid-state</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mobile LiDAR Scanner technology can be categorized into two main types based on the method of data acquisition: mechanical and solid-state. Mechanical LiDAR scanners use moving components such as rotating mirrors to generate 3D point cloud data, while solid-state LiDAR scanners rely on fixed components like laser diodes and receivers for data collection. Both types have their own strengths and weaknesses, with mechanical scanners offering higher accuracy but being more prone to wear and tear, while solid-state scanners provide faster data capture and are more robust for long-term use.</p></p>
