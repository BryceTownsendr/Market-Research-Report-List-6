<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigeration Tunnel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooling</li><li>Air-cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigeration tunnels are used for quick cooling or freezing of products in various industries. There are two main types of refrigeration tunnels: liquid cooling and air-cooling. Liquid cooling systems use a pumped refrigerant to transfer heat away from products, while air-cooling systems use fans to circulate chilled air. Liquid cooling is typically more energy efficient and faster, making it ideal for high-volume production lines. However, air-cooling systems are more cost-effective and simpler to install, making them a popular choice for smaller operations.</p></p>
