<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Inkjet Print-heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal inkjet print-head market is primarily divided into two types: continuous inkjet and random inkjet. Continuous inkjet (CIJ) printers eject a continuous stream of ink droplets, allowing for high-speed printing, ideal for industrial applications such as packaging and labeling. In contrast, random inkjet systems, often found in consumer printers, selectively fire ink droplets only when needed, resulting in more controlled output. Both technologies leverage thermal energy to create ink droplets, catering to diverse printing needs across various industries.</p></p>
