<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dimmable LED Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</li><li>Analogue Dimming</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dimmable LED driver market features two primary types: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Analog Dimming. PWM involves rapidly switching the LED on and off to control brightness, providing efficient dimming without color shifting. It is widely used for its precision and energy efficiency. In contrast, Analog Dimming adjusts the current flowing to the LED, offering a simpler approach but potentially leading to less efficient performance and color variation at lower dimming levels. Both methods cater to diverse application needs in lighting solutions.</p></p>
