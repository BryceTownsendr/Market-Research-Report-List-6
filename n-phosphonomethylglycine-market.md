<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IDA Process</li><li>Glycine Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, commonly known as glyphosate, is produced primarily through two processes: the IDA process and the Glycine process. The IDA process utilizes isopropanolamine for the synthesis, resulting in high purity and efficiency. In contrast, the Glycine process involves the reaction of phosphorus precursors with glycine, which may offer cost advantages but can yield varied purity levels. Both methods cater to distinct segments of the agricultural market, influencing glyphosate's availability and pricing in different regions.</p></p>
