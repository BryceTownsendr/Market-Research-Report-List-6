<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Sonar Data Recording System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar Type</li><li>Active Sonar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submarine sonar data recording systems come in two main types: passive sonar and active sonar. Passive sonar systems are designed to listen for and record acoustic signals emitted by other vessels or marine life, without emitting any signals themselves. Active sonar systems, on the other hand, emit pulses of sound waves and record the echoes that bounce back, allowing for the detection of objects in the water. Both types cater to different needs and applications within the submarine sonar data recording system market.</p></p>
