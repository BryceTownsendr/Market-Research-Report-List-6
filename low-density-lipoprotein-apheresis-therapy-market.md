<p><strong>The Low-density Lipoprotein Apheresis Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Filtration LDL Apheresis Therapy</li><li>Cascade Filtration LDL Apheresis Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL) Apheresis Therapy is a procedure used to reduce LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia, especially those unresponsive to standard treatments. There are two main types: Double Filtration LDL Apheresis Therapy, which utilizes a two-step filtration process to selectively remove LDL particles while retaining other blood components, and Cascade Filtration LDL Apheresis Therapy, which employs a series of filtration membranes that allow for the gradual removal of LDL, enhancing efficiency and patient safety. Both methods aim to improve cardiovascular health.</p></p>
