<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Sound Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted</li><li>Structure-Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete sound barrier market is primarily divided into two types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted barriers. Ground-mounted barriers are installed directly on the ground and are typically used along highways or railways to mitigate noise pollution from surrounding areas. In contrast, structure-mounted barriers are affixed to existing structures, such as buildings or bridges, providing an effective solution for urban environments where space is limited. Both types aim to enhance sound insulation and improve the quality of life in nearby residential or commercial areas.</p></p>
