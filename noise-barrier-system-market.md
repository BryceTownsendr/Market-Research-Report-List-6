<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structure Mounted</li><li>Ground Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Noise Barrier System market comprises two main types: structure-mounted and ground-mounted barriers. Structure-mounted barriers are attached to existing buildings, walls, or posts, effectively reducing noise transmission from adjacent roadways or transportation sources. Conversely, ground-mounted barriers are built on the ground, typically along highways or railways, and are designed to block sound from reaching surrounding areas. Both types aim to enhance acoustic comfort in residential and commercial spaces by mitigating environmental noise pollution.</p></p>
