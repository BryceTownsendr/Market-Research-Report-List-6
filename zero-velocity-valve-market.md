<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Velocity Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Barrel End Type</li><li>Flange End Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zero Velocity Valves are designed to prevent water hammer in pumping systems by closing rapidly when a pump shuts down, preventing reverse flow. There are two main types in the market: Barrel End Type and Flange End Type. Barrel End Type valves are directly screwed onto the pump discharge nozzle, while Flange End Type valves are connected via flanges. Both types serve the same purpose of controlling water hammer and protecting pump systems from damage due to sudden changes in velocity.</p></p>
