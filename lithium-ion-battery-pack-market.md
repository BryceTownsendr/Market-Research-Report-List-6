<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium-ion Battery Pack Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Series Battery Pack</li><li>Parallel Battery Pack</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lithium-ion battery packs can be categorized into two main types: series and parallel. A series battery pack connects multiple cells end-to-end, which increases the overall voltage while maintaining the same capacity. This configuration is ideal for applications requiring higher voltage levels. Conversely, a parallel battery pack connects cells side-by-side, which maintains the voltage but increases the total capacity and discharge current. This setup is beneficial for applications needing longer runtime and higher power output.</p></p>
