<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical CO2 Sensors</li><li>NDIR CO2 Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 sensors market consists primarily of two types: chemical CO2 sensors and NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared) CO2 sensors. Chemical CO2 sensors utilize chemical reactions to detect carbon dioxide levels, often providing lower cost but less accuracy and sensitivity. In contrast, NDIR sensors use infrared light to measure CO2 concentration, offering greater precision, stability, and a broader range of applications in industries like HVAC, agriculture, and safety monitoring. Both sensor types play essential roles in environmental monitoring and control.</p></p>
