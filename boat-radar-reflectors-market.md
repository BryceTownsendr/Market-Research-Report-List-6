<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boat Radar Reflectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Octahedral</li><li>Luneberg Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boat radar reflectors are important for increasing visibility and safety on the water. There are two main types of reflectors commonly used: the octahedral reflector and the Luneberg lens reflector. </p><p>- Octahedral reflectors are made up of a series of flat surfaces that bounce radar signals back towards the source, providing a strong return signal. </p><p>- Luneberg lens reflectors use a spherical shape to focus and reflect radar signals in a more controlled manner, offering improved performance in certain conditions. Both types are essential for enhancing the radar visibility of boats at sea.</p></p>
