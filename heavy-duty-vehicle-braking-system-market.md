<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-duty Vehicle Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty vehicle braking system market primarily comprises two types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes utilize a cylindrical drum that rotates with the wheel, applying friction from brake shoes against the drum's inner surface, providing robust stopping power. In contrast, disc brakes feature a flat disc that rotates with the wheel, using calipers to squeeze brake pads against the disc for effective braking. Both systems are essential for heavy-duty vehicles, offering safety and performance suited to their operational demands.</p></p>
