<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The road surface sensor market is divided into two main types: active and passive sensors. Active sensors emit signals, such as radar or infrared, and measure the response reflected from the road surface, providing real-time data on conditions like moisture and temperature. Conversely, passive sensors rely on existing environmental signals, like ambient light or temperature variations, to monitor road surfaces without actively sending out signals. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing road safety, maintenance, and management systems.</p></p>
