<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Lead Acid Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell</li><li>Valve Regulated Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary lead acid batteries are commonly classified into two types: open cell and valve regulated batteries. Open cell batteries contain liquid electrolyte that requires regular maintenance to check and refill the water level. On the other hand, valve regulated batteries are sealed, maintenance-free batteries that use a valve to release excess gases to prevent overpressure. Both types of batteries are widely used in various stationary applications such as backup power systems, telecommunications, and emergency lighting.</p></p>
