<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fabric Hot-Melt Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reactive Hot Melt Adhesives</li><li>Reactive Hot Melt Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of fabric hot-melt adhesives - non-reactive hot melt adhesives and reactive hot melt adhesives. Non-reactive hot melt adhesives are solid at room temperature and soften when heated, providing a strong bond when cooled. Reactive hot melt adhesives, on the other hand, undergo a chemical reaction when heated, forming a permanent bond upon cooling. Non-reactive hot melt adhesives are commonly used for temporary bonds, while reactive hot melt adhesives are preferred for permanent fabric bonding applications.</p></p>
